     short_description: Build an scikit-learn model to predict churn using customer telco data, with MlFlow Experiments
     long_description: >-
        This project is used for CML Workshop. It is based on Customer Churn AMP and highlights all of the major functionality of CML.
        The project contains code to ingest and explore data, train a model, including experimentation with mlflow, deployment of the best model 
        and tracking its performance with MLOps. An interactive Flask application is deployed as part of this project as well.
